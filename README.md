# Global-Skincare-and-Beauty-E-Commerce-Dashboard
## Bacground and Overview
This dashboard analyzes a global e-commerce skincare & beauty dataset covering 2020–2023. It transforms raw orders, customer, product and financial data into actionable insights that answer: Which markets and regions drive revenue and profit? How do product categories and discounts affect margins? Where should marketing and inventory focus next?

Using region, country, channel and customer segmentation, the project uncovers trends, seasonal patterns, top products and customer cohorts that informed strategic decisions on assortment, pricing, and geographic expansion.

Insights and recommendations are provided on the following key areas:
- **Profit Analysis:** Identify which product, region, and market brought in the most profit for the company.
- **Sales Trend Analysis:** Evaluation of historical sales pattern, both globally and by region focusing on revenue, order volume and customer with the most orders
- **Regional comparison:** An evaluation of sales, orders and profit by region

## Executive Summary
### Overview of Findings
The analysis of the global skincare company’s e-commerce data from 2020 to 2023 revealed steady growth across key business metrics, including orders, customers, and revenue. Over the four-year period, the company experienced a consistent upward trend in performance, driven by strong product sales and regional market expansion.

A total of 51,290 thousand orders were placed, with demand increasing year after year. The product catalog consisted of over 3,500 thousand items, among which “Herbal Essence Bio” emerged as the best-selling product. The customer base grew steadily, exceeding 17 thousand customers, with a few high-value customers contributing significantly to overall sales.

### Sales Trend:
- Between 2020 and 2023, the company recorded over $6 million in total sales. Sales showed a consistent year-on-year increase, indicating steady business growth over the four-year period. Both sales value and sales volume rose over time, reflecting higher customer demand and stronger market performance. Seasonal trends were also observed — sales typically started lower at the beginning of each year and peaked in November and December, likely driven by holiday promotions and festive shopping periods.
- Over the years (2020–2022), the average unit price — the average amount customers paid per product — was increasing each year. However, in 2023, that upward trend reversed slightly, as the average price per product dropped by 1.6% compared to 2022. This is probably due to the discounting of prices which rose much higher during that same year.
- The regions with the highest sales between 2020 and 2023 were Western Europe ($762,855) and Central America ($729,231). In contrast, the lowest sales were recorded in Eastern Europe, Western Africa, North Africa, Eastern Africa, Central Africa, Southern Africa, Canada, and Central Asia, each generating less than $170,000 in total sales. Across broader market categories, the Asia-Pacific region led with $1,831,648 in sales, while Africa recorded the lowest overall sales, totaling $486,811 during the same period.

### Profit Trends:
- The company’s profit margin stands at 16.35%, meaning that for every $1 earned in sales, $0.16 is retained as profit after covering all costs. While total profits increased over time, the profit margin declined by 2.6% between 2021 and 2022, and fell sharply by 29.1% in 2023, alongside a drop in total profit. This indicates that the company’s efficiency in converting sales into profit has weakened, likely due to rising costs or heavier discounting strategies that reduced overall profitability.
- The total discounts given to customers increased steadily over the years, suggesting that the company was selling more but earning less per sale. This indicates that while the discount strategy successfully boosted sales volume, it negatively affected profit margins.
- Like sales, profits typically peaked in November and December, but in 2022 they peaked in June and in 2023 in August. This shift in profit peaks from year-end to mid-year suggests changing buying patterns or marketing strategies, possibly influenced by new campaigns, regional expansion, or shifting seasonal demand.

### Customer Analysis:
- The Corporate segment accounted for more than half of the company’s total profit at 57.73%, while the Consumer and Self-Employed segments contributed 33.08% and 9.19%, respectively.
- The top-spending customer, identified as ID “LS-172001402”, spent a total of $7,351 between 2020 and 2023 and is located in the Central U.S. region.
- The customer with ID “SV-203651406” placed the highest number of orders across all years.
