# Global-Skincare-and-Beauty-E-Commerce-Dashboard
## Background and Overview
This dashboard analyzes a global e-commerce skincare & beauty dataset covering 2020–2023. It transforms raw orders, customer, product and financial data into actionable insights that answer: Which markets and regions drive revenue and profit? How do product categories and discounts affect margins? Where should marketing and inventory focus next?

Using region, country, channel and customer segmentation, the project uncovers trends, seasonal patterns, top products and customer cohorts that informed strategic decisions on assortment, pricing, and geographic expansion.

Insights and recommendations are provided on the following key areas:
- **Sales Trend:** Evaluation of historical sales pattern, both globally and by region focusing on revenue, order volume and customer with the most orders
- **Profit Trend:** Identify which product, region, and market brought in the most profit for the company.
- **Customer Trends:** Analyses which segment brings in the most sales and if they are profitable
- **Product Inventory:** Identify which product category was ordered the most and how profitable the products are to the company.

## Executive Summary
### Overview of Findings
The analysis of the global skincare company’s e-commerce data from 2020 to 2023 revealed steady growth across key business metrics, including orders, customers, and revenue. Over the four-year period, the company experienced a consistent upward trend in performance, driven by strong product sales and regional market expansion.

A total of 51,290 thousand orders were placed, with demand increasing year after year. The product catalog consisted of over 3,500 thousand items, among which “Herbal Essence Bio” emerged as the best-selling product. The customer base grew steadily, exceeding 17 thousand customers, with a few high-value customers contributing significantly to overall sales.

### Sales Trend:
- Between 2020 and 2023, the company recorded over $6 million in total sales. Sales showed a consistent year-on-year increase, indicating steady business growth over the four-year period. Both sales value and sales volume rose over time, reflecting higher customer demand and stronger market performance. Seasonal trends were also observed — sales typically started lower at the beginning of each year and peaked in November and December, likely driven by holiday promotions and festive shopping periods.
- Over the years (2020–2022), the average unit price — the average amount customers paid per product — was increasing each year. However, in 2023, that upward trend reversed slightly, as the average price per product dropped by 1.6% compared to 2022. This is probably due to the discounting of prices which rose much higher during that same year.
- The regions with the highest sales between 2020 and 2023 were Western Europe ($762,855) and Central America ($729,231). In contrast, the lowest sales were recorded in Eastern Europe, Western Africa, North Africa, Eastern Africa, Central Africa, Southern Africa, Canada, and Central Asia, each generating less than $170,000 in total sales. Across broader market categories, the Asia-Pacific region led with $1,831,648 in sales, while Africa recorded the lowest overall sales, totaling $486,811 during the same period.

### Profit Trends:
- The company’s profit margin stands at 16.35%, meaning that for every $1 earned in sales, $0.16 is retained as profit after covering all costs. While total profits increased over time, the profit margin declined by 2.6% between 2021 and 2022, and fell sharply by 29.1% in 2023, alongside a drop in total profit. This indicates that the company’s efficiency in converting sales into profit has weakened, likely due to rising costs or heavier discounting strategies that reduced overall profitability.
- The total discounts given to customers increased steadily over the years, suggesting that the company was selling more but earning less per sale. This indicates that while the discount strategy successfully boosted sales volume, it negatively affected profit margins.
- Like sales, profits typically peaked in November and December, but in 2022 they peaked in June and in 2023 in August. This shift in profit peaks from year-end to mid-year suggests changing buying patterns or marketing strategies, possibly influenced by new campaigns, regional expansion, or shifting seasonal demand.

### Customer Analysis:
- The Corporate segment accounted for more than half of the company’s total profit at 57.73%, while the Consumer and Self-Employed segments contributed 33.08% and 9.19%, respectively.
- The top-spending customer, identified as ID “LS-172001402”, spent a total of $7,351 between 2020 and 2023 and is located in the Central U.S. region.
- The customer with ID “SV-203651406” placed the highest number of orders across all years.
- An analysis of customer performance revealed that a small group of customers contributed a significant portion of total sales and profit, indicating a concentrated customer base. High-value customers, such as Customer ID “SV-203651406”, consistently made the most orders and generated substantial revenue. This suggests that loyal and repeat customers play a key role in driving business performance, highlighting the importance of customer retention strategies to sustain growth and profitability.

### Product Inventory:
- The Body Care category consistently had the highest number of products available, which aligns with its position as the top contributor to both sales and profit. In contrast, Home Accessories had the second-highest product availability and also generated the second-highest sales, yet it recorded a loss instead of a profit, suggesting potential issues with pricing, cost management, or discounting strategies within that category.

### Recommendations
- **Review Discount Strategy:** Although sales have grown consistently, increasing discounts have reduced profit margins. The company should evaluate its discounting approach to strike a balance between boosting sales volume and maintaining profitability. Introducing targeted or seasonal discounts instead of broad markdowns could help sustain revenue without eroding margins
- **Optimize Underperforming Categories:** The Home Accessories category generated high sales but reported losses, suggesting possible pricing or cost inefficiencies. The company should reassess production costs, pricing structure, and discount policies within this category to restore profitability
- **Focus on High-Performing Segments:** With the Corporate segment contributing 57.73% of total profit, the company should strengthen partnerships and loyalty programs for corporate clients while exploring opportunities to expand this segment further.
- **Expand in High-Growth Regions:** With Asia-Pacific leading in sales and Western Europe showing strong profits, the company can leverage successful strategies from these regions and replicate them in emerging markets to drive balanced global growth.
